Submission for Project 9: Honeypot
-

Which Honeypot(s) I deployed: 
-

- Dionaea Honeypot from MHN. 

Any issues you encountered: 
-

- I think the biggest issue I encountered was downloading the SDK and figuring out how to test if Dionaea was working. 

- I could not get it to work on first or second or third install, but on the fourth install it seemed to work fine.


A summary of the data collected: 
-

I was able to get a total of 103 attacks, all attacks were from the Dionaea Honeypot (PCP).
